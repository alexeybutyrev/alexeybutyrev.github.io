			.attr("href", d => d.link)  // Add hyperlink
			.append("span")
			.text(d => d.text)
			.style("font-size", function (d) {
				return Math.random() * 24 + 12 + "px"; // Random font size (adjust as needed)
			})
			.style("margin", "5px")  // Add spacing between words
			.style("color", "#000")  // Text color
			.style("text-decoration", "none")

	In this example:

	The words array contains the words you want in the word cloud, along with their respective hyperlinks.

	We create hyperlinks for each word by using the <a> element and setting the href attribute to the link associated
		with the word.

		The span element is used to display the word text, and you can style it as needed.

		Random font sizes and spacing between words are applied for a more visually appealing word cloud. You can adjust
		these styles as desired.

		This code will create a word cloud with the words "CrossFit," "Chess," and "Reading," each with a hyperlink to a
		corresponding webpage. The appearance and styling can be further customized to match your design preferences.

			I begin my weekdays with invigorating <a href="https://games.crossfit.com/athlete/1683143">CrossFit</a>
			classes.
			My quality time with my 11-year-old son is a cherished
			priority. Saturdays are dedicated to conquering <a href="https://leetcode.com/alexey_wish/"> coding
				competitions</a>, and my latest passion is tackling <a

				Races</a>. I also indulge in beach volleyball and chess occasionally, though not as frequently as I'd
			prefer. My
			love for reading is evident; you can explore my book recommendations on my <a
