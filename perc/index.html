		I begin my weekdays with invigorating <a href="https://games.crossfit.com/athlete/1683143">CrossFit</a> classes.
		My quality time with my 11-year-old son is a cherished
		priority. Saturdays are dedicated to conquering <a href="https://leetcode.com/alexey_wish/"> coding
			competitions</a>, and my latest passion is tackling <a
			href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SqelAr8MxaKq5mMCCU8aXsHf0lpdco-K/view?usp=sharing">Spartan
			Races</a>. I also indulge in beach volleyball and chess occasionally, though not as frequently as I'd
		prefer. My
		love for reading is evident; you can explore my book recommendations on my <a
			href="https://www.goodreads.com/alexeybutyrev"> Goodreads</a> profile.
